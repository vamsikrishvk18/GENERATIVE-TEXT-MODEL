##DESCRIPTION-This task focuses on building a **generative text model** using a pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The main objective is to create a Python-based system that can take a short piece of text (called a prompt) and generate a longer, meaningful continuation of that text. GPT-2 is a transformer-based language model trained on a large corpus of text data, which enables it to understand language patterns, context, and grammar, allowing it to generate human-like text. The task begins by installing the necessary libraries, such as `transformers` and `torch`. After that, the GPT-2 model and its corresponding tokenizer are loaded. The user then inputs a text prompt, which the system encodes into tokens. These tokens are processed by the model to generate a sequence of output tokens based on sampling strategies like top-k, top-p (nucleus sampling), and temperature control to ensure the text is creative and diverse. Finally, the generated tokens are decoded back into readable text and displayed. This task is useful for applications such as automated story generation, content writing, chatbots, and other natural language generation tasks. Through this process, one gains practical knowledge of working with large language models and the basics of text generation using deep learning.
